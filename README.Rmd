quickpsy fits psychometric functions for several conditions. 

## Install

First, you need to download and install [R](http://cran.rstudio.com) (we also recommend [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)).

Then, you need to install the package boot, DEoptim, devtools, dplyr, ggplot2 and 
tidyr.
For example, to install devtools

```R
install.packages('devtools')
```

and then to install quickpsy from github (the vignettes, which have extra tutorials, take a while to be built; if you don't want to build them `build_vignettes = F`)

```R
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('danilinares/quickpsy', build_vignettes = T)
```

## Example

```R
library(boot)
library(DEoptim)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

library(MPDiR) # contains the Vernier data
data(Vernier) # ?Venier for the reference
fit <- quickpsy(Vernier, Phaseshift, NumUpward, N,
                grouping = .(Direction, WaveForm, TempFreq))
plotcurves(fit)
plotpara(fit)
plotthresholds(fit)
```

## Help and tutorials

For specific functions
```R
?plotcurves
```
You can find further guidande in the vignettes 
```R
browseVignettes('quickpsy')
```
