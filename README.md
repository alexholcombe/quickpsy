quickpsy is an R package developed by [Daniel Linares](http://www.dlinares.org/) and [Joan LÃ³pez-Moliner](http://www.ub.edu/viscagroup/joan/) to fit psychometric functions for several conditions and produce associated plots. In comparison with other R packages that fit psychometric functions, such as [psyphy](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psyphy/index.html) and [modelfree](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/d.h.foster/software-modelfree/latest/home), quickpsy was built with the idea of fitting and plotting many conditions as automatically as possible. To that end, it depends heavily on Hadley Wickham packages [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and [dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html).

To understand the fundamentals of fitting psychometric functions in R, we recommend the book [Modeling Psychophysical Data in R](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461444749).

Features
--------

-   Fits and plots several conditions simultaneosly (using maximum likelihood).

-   Exploits the computational speed of [dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html).

-   Initial parameters are not necessary.

-   Calculates parametric and non-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals.

-   Guess and lapses can be fixed or estimated as parameters.

-   Fits cumulative normal, logistic, weibull functions or any function defined by the user.

-   Facilitates the reading of several data files.

-   The optimization can call *DEoptim* which uses differential evolution optimization.

Install
-------

First, you need to download and install [R](http://cran.rstudio.com) (we also recommend [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)).

Then, you need to install the package boot, DEoptim, devtools, dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyr. For example, to install devtools

``` {.r}
install.packages('devtools')
```

and then install quickpsy from github

``` {.r}
library(devtools)
install_github('danilinares/quickpsy')
```

Example
-------

``` {.r}
library(boot)
library(DEoptim)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(MPDiR) # contains the Vernier data
library(quickpsy)

data(Vernier) # ?Venier for the reference
fit <- quickpsy(Vernier, Phaseshift, NumUpward, N,
                grouping = .(Direction, WaveForm, TempFreq))
plotcurves(fit)
plotpara(fit)
plotthresholds(fit)
```

Help and tutorials
------------------

For specific functions

``` {.r}
?plotcurves
